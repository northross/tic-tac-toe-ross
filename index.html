        <p class="odd"> 1. Tic-Tac-Toe is played on a grid that is comprised of nine squares, between two players.
          <br>2. Each of the two players is assigned a mark, an X or an O.
          <br>3. Alternating turns, each player selects a square on the grid to place her mark.
          <br>4. The first player to get three of her marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) is the winner.
          <br>5. If all of the squares are full & there is no winner, the game is over - it's a tie.
          <br>6. Everyone is a winner when they play Tic-Tac-Toe with a friend!
