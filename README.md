## Description:
[A single-page application that allows user to play a (Tic-Tac-Toe) game using a custom built engine on a simple interface.]

### Website: [https://northross.github.io/tic-tac-toe-ross/]

#### List of Technologies Used:
1. html
2. css
3. scss
4. javascript
5. git/github
6. ajax
7. jquery
8. Google fonts

#### Planning:
The project has a few parts that tie together. My first step was building a simple wireframe to have a vision of the page before execution and building a user story to be aware of functions to create for the game to be operative and user-friendly.
Next was to create simple board to display using html and css and js. HTML and css worked together to give a structure. JS allowed to board to display results based on the game engine.
The game engine built in JS allows for proper space selection and winner calculations.
Once the board was functional, the user and game API connections were important to allow user to have credentials and record games and moves on the board.
Last, I was to finely tune the styling of the page.

#### Challenges
For a first project it was challenging to take on feats that I have not had much experience with before. More goes into building than originally thought. I think for my next assignment, I will be taking one task at a time more considerably and asking for assistance. Sure, peers/instructors helped, but this would not have been possible for me alone. It takes patience and sometimes distance to realize what is working correctly and incorrectly.


#### Unsolved Problems:
1. test for a Tie
2. improved Styling
3. report games played
